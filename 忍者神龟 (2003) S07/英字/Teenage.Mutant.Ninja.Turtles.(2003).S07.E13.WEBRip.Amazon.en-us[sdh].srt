1
00:00:06,351 --> 00:00:09,699
Donatello: COUNTLESS MILES OF CYBERSPACE COMBED OVER.

2
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:12,909
INNUMEROUS LINES OF PROGRAMMING CODE SCOURED.

3
00:00:12,943 --> 00:00:16,775
A MYRIAD OF BYTES, NODES, AND CACHES SCRUTINIZED.

4
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:22,919
BUT FINALLY, 92,643 NANOSCOPIC DATA BITS LATER,

5
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:25,887
OUR FATHER IS ABOUT TO BE WHOLE AGAIN.

6
00:00:25,922 --> 00:00:28,407
UH, THAT'S ASSUMING THIS WORKS.

7
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:30,375
IT HAS TO WORK.

8
00:00:30,409 --> 00:00:34,068
I DESIGNED THE CYBERMAT PORTAL TO CONVERT MATTER INTO CODE,

9
00:00:34,103 --> 00:00:37,554
SO BY REVERSING THE POLARITY OF THE DEFAULT STASIS APPLICATION,

10
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:40,385
CODE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE CONVERTED BACK INTO MATTER.

11
00:00:40,419 --> 00:00:42,732
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING COVERED, DONNIE.

12
00:00:42,766 --> 00:00:45,700
YEAH. ESPECIALLY THE BIG WORDS.

13
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:47,495
WELL, HERE GOES.

14
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:16,421
FATHER! FATHER!FATHER!

15
00:01:19,182 --> 00:01:20,597
 ALL RIGHT! YEAH!

16
00:01:20,632 --> 00:01:21,805
WE WERE SO WORRIED.

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,807
HOW MANY FINGERS AM I HOLDING UP?

18
00:01:23,842 --> 00:01:26,534
ARE YOU OKAY? HOW YOU FEELING?

19
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:28,260
I FEEL...

20
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:30,159
WHOLE...

21
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:32,609
AND HAPPY TO BE HOME...

22
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:35,095
THOUGH A BIT LIGHT-HEADED.

23
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:43,033
THE MATTER CONVERSION PROCESS IS STRESSFUL, FATHER.

24
00:01:43,068 --> 00:01:44,621
LET'S GET YOU SOME REST.

25
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:46,002
Serling: REST?

26
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:48,280
HE NEEDS TO PACK.

27
00:01:48,315 --> 00:01:50,765
WE'RE SCHEDULED TO DEPART FOR THE WEDDING IN MINUTES.

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,320
OH. AND WELCOME BACK, SIR.

29
00:01:53,354 --> 00:01:55,667
UH, WEDDING?

30
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:57,738
YEAH, CASEY AND APRIL'S.

31
00:01:57,772 --> 00:01:59,498
ABOUT TIME, RIGHT?

32
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:03,399
MY SONS, LET US CELEBRATE OUR REUNION.

33
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:06,160
AND I CAN THINK OF NO BETTER PLACE TO DO SO

34
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:09,198
THAN THE UNION OF CASEY AND APRIL.

35
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:12,028
FATHER, IF YOU'RE UP FOR IT, SO AM I.

36
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:15,445
LET'S FINALLY PUT THE PROBLEMS OF CYBERSPACE BEHIND US.

63
00:03:29,105 --> 00:03:30,451
YOU KNOW, RAPH,

64
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:33,489
SOME PEOPLE HEAD TO THE COUNTRY FOR A SLOWER PACE OF LIFE.

65
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:36,216
SORRY, BRO, BUT I AIN'T SOME PEOPLE.

66
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,596
I'M THE BEST MAN.

67
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:41,600
I GOT DUTIES, LIKE TEACHING CASEY HOW TO TIE A TIE...

68
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:43,499
WHICH, MAY TAKE A WHILE

69
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:46,536
SEEING AS HOW THAT AIN'T ONE OF MY BETTER NINJA SKILLS.

70
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:50,782
MAN, SERLING, I AM SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS.

71
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:52,404
I LOVE WEDDINGS.

72
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,096
WHEN HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO A WEDDING?

73
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:56,615
BEEN TO? NEVER.

74
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,066
SEEN ON TV? ALL THE TIME.

75
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,103
EVERY SERIES EVENTUALLY DOES A WEDDING EPISODE, DUDE.

76
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:03,277
I'M NOT PICKING UP

77
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:05,969
ANY VIRTUAL FLUCTUATIONS OR DISTORTIONS, MASTER.

78
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:07,937
THE DIGITAL-TO-PHYSICAL CONVERSION

79
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:09,870
HAS BEEN A COMPLETE SUCCESS.

80
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:12,907
I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT, MY SON.

81
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:15,496
HEY, GUYS. WE'RE HERE.

82
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:25,644
THEY'RE HERE!

83
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,094
AND SO IS MASTER SPLINTER.

84
00:04:27,128 --> 00:04:29,683
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

85
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:32,064
THIS MAKES OUR WEDDING EVEN MORE SPECIAL.

86
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,238
PERFECT, EVEN.

87
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,965
SENSEI, YOU LOOK LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.

88
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,692
HEH. BETTER THAN A MILLION PIECES, RIGHT?

89
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:41,281
COME ON IN, EVERYONE. TAKE A LOAD OFF.

90
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:48,011
I'M TELLIN' YA, THE SHREDDER NEVER STOOD A CHANCE.

91
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:49,772
YES, I HAVE HEARD.

92
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:53,327
MY SONS HAVE MADE THEIR FATHER QUITE PROUD.

93
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:56,813
HOW ABOUT YOU, MASTER SPLINTER?

94
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:58,574
WHAT WAS CYBERSPACE LIKE?

95
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:01,335
IT WAS...STRANGE.

96
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,682
I HAD NO SINGLE SENSE OF SELF,

97
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:08,100
BUT, RATHER, A MULTITUDE OF THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS.

98
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:10,137
Splinter: COMMON TO THEM ALL, HOWEVER,

99
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:13,382
WAS A LONGING TO RETURN TO MY FAMILY.

100
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,556
WELL, DONNIE SURE TOOK CARE OF THAT.

101
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:18,179
YEAH, THAT BIG OLD BRAIN OF HIS

102
00:05:18,214 --> 00:05:21,976
WAS WORKING OVERTIME TO GET YOU OUT OF THERE SAFE AND SOUND.

103
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:24,116
HUH? HUH?HUH?

104
00:05:24,151 --> 00:05:26,705
ARE YOU GUYS EXPECTING SOMEONE?

105
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,915
NO, NONE OF THE GUESTS ARE DUE TO ARRIVE UNTIL THE MORNING.

106
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:48,486
MA?

107
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,970
CASEY!

108
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:55,734
THAT'S ASSUMING CASEY GOT THE DATES ON THE INVITATIONS RIGHT.

109
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:58,254
WELL, UH, ALL THOSE LETTERS AND NUMBERS

110
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:00,981
SEEM THE SAME WHEN YOU'RE WRITIN' IN CALLIGRAPHY.

111
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:04,433
HEY, CUZ.

112
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,434
UHH!

00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:07,815
WHAT'S SHAKING, APRIL?

114
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,783
WHA-- UH...

115
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:12,164
Casey's Mom: DON'T YOU WORRY, CASEY.

116
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,511
I TOLD YOUR COUSIN SID

117
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:16,341
IF HE TELLS A SOUL ABOUT YOUR SPECIAL FRIENDS,

118
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,068
I'LL BUST HIS KNEECAPS.

119
00:06:20,103 --> 00:06:22,623
WHAT A LONG JOURNEY THIS HAS BEEN.

120
00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:24,625
Together: ANCIENT ONE?!

121
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,111
GUESS I'D BETTER GO GET THE SPARE BLANKETS.

122
00:06:28,146 --> 00:06:30,873
BLANKETS? WHAT A TREAT.

123
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:32,288
PROFESSOR?!PROFESSOR?!PROFESSOR?!

124
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:34,877
WHAT UP, GUYS?ANGEL?

125
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:37,500

126
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:38,846
I HEAR YOU.

127
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:42,125
NOTHING BEATS BEING SURROUNDED BY FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

128
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:56,346
WE HAVE THEIR POSITION,

129
00:06:56,381 --> 00:06:59,591
AND SOON, IN THE NAME OF THE MASTER,

130
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:02,214
WE SHALL HAVE THEIR HEADS!

131
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:11,431
Raphael: I'M TELLING YOU -- THE RABBIT GOES IN THE HOLE,

132
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,502
AROUND THE TREE, AND THEN...

133
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:14,779
VOILà!

134
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:16,746

UH, YOU SURE THIS IS RIGHT?

137
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:21,717
UH, GUYS?

138
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:24,029
THE CEREMONY STARTS IN AN HOUR.

139
00:07:24,064 --> 00:07:26,100
SO, GETTING NERVOUS YET?

140
00:07:26,135 --> 00:07:27,481
ME? NERVOUS?

141
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:28,931
COME ON!

142
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:32,210
I'VE TAKEN ON ENTIRE STREET GANGS SINGLE-HANDEDLY...

143
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:34,868
GONE MANO A MANO WITH SOME OF THE BIGGEST BADDIES

144
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:36,317
IN THE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD...

145
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:38,837
FOUGHT MONSTERS, MUTANTS, AND ALIENS.

146
00:07:38,872 --> 00:07:41,012
I MEAN, YOU THINK I'LL GET NERVOUS

147
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:44,464

WHOA, THERE!

151
00:07:51,574 --> 00:07:52,886

THANKS, MIKEY.

160
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:12,181

BRIDESMAID?!

162
00:08:13,872 --> 00:08:15,702
GIVE A TURTLE A LITTLE RESPECT.

I'M THE MAID OF HONOR. YAAAHH!

164
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:20,292

DONATELLO.

172
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,288
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

173
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,571
WHERE IS YOUR GIFT, GEN?

174
00:08:57,606 --> 00:08:59,573
GIFTS, USAGI?

175
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:02,783
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING GIFTS?

176
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:04,958
WELL, I'M SURE...

177
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:09,618
HISOMI WON'T MIND IF I SHARE HIS.

178
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:20,076
I GUESS, UH, YOU'RE HISOMI.

179

181
00:09:27,187 --> 00:09:28,498
THANK GOODNESS.

182
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:31,191
WE WOULDN'T WANT A REPEAT OF WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME.

183
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:33,365
I STILL SMELL LIKE SOY SAUCE.

184
00:09:34,712 --> 00:09:36,714
YOU OKAY, LEATHERHEAD?

185
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:40,096
OH, YES. I'M FINE, ANGEL.

186
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:43,824
I JUST ALWAYS CRY AT WEDDINGS.

187
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:48,449
WELL, THAT'S JUST ABOUT EVERYONE.

188
00:09:48,484 --> 00:09:49,796
YOU GUYS SEEN APRIL?

189
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,521
I HAVEN'T SEEN APRIL. SHE'S NOT HERE.

190
00:09:51,556 --> 00:09:53,282
YOU THINK SHE'S HAVIN' SECOND THOUGHTS?

191
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:55,111
AW, I KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

192
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:56,975
EASY, MY SON.

193
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,632
IT IS TRADITION FOR THE GROOM

194
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:01,290
NOT TO SEE THE BRIDE BEFORE THE CEREMONY.

195
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:04,189
SHE IS PREPARING HERSELF IN THE FARMHOUSE.

196
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:06,778
I WILL FETCH HER.

197
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:19,204
HMM.

198
00:10:25,728 --> 00:10:26,936
THE FOOT!

199
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,456
I MUST WARN THE OTHERS.

200
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,285
OH! OH.

201
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,118
YOU WILL WARN NO ONE, RODENT.

202
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:56,241
Man: I WONDER WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG.

203
00:10:58,071 --> 00:10:59,797
April: Psst! GUYS?

204
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:01,799
EVERYTHING OKAY?

205
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,317
APRIL?

206
00:11:03,352 --> 00:11:05,285
WHOA...BABE.

207
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:07,943
YOU LOOK BEAU-- BEA--

208
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:10,048
BEA-- UGH.

209
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,532
WHOA!

210
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,362
EASY, KILLER.

211
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:15,157
SORRY FOR THE DELAY.

212
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,814
MASTER SPLINTER WENT TO FIND YOU.

213
00:11:16,848 --> 00:11:18,505
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM?

214
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:19,851
NO.

215
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:21,819
I WONDER WHERE HE COULD --

216
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,548
WHOA! MASTER SPLINTER!

217
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:31,621
MASTER SPLINTER...

218
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:32,795
HE'S HERE.

219
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,865
HE'S --

220
00:11:38,525 --> 00:11:40,561
WHAT THE SHELL'S GOING ON?

221
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:44,911
YOUR LONG-AWAITED DEMISE.

222
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:49,674
Donatello: THE SHREDDER?

223
00:11:56,405 --> 00:11:58,579
ATTACK!

224
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:09,418
HA!

225
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:17,012
I DON'T REMEMBER GETTING YOUR RSVP, BUCKET-FOR-BRAINS.

226
00:12:17,046 --> 00:12:20,532
YEAH. LIKE, DIDN'T WE FRY YOU UP EXTRA-CRISPY-STYLE?

227
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,776
MY BODY PERHAPS.

228
00:12:22,811 --> 00:12:26,021
BUT THE ELECTRIC CURRENT YOU SOUGHT TO DESTROY ME WITH

229
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:28,817
DID NOT DAMAGE MY DIGITAL CORE.

230
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:30,301
DIGITAL CORE?

231
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,612
YES.

232
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:36,894
I ESCAPED BACK TO CYBERSPACE

233
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:41,381
WHERE I WAS ABLE TO ABSORB THE MASSIVE INFLUX OF ENERGY.

234
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:46,835
ENERGY THAT ALLOWED ME TO RECONSTITUTE MYSELF

235
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:49,423
TO BECOME MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER.

236
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:52,150
YEAH. I'M KIND OF GETTIN' THAT.

237
00:12:52,185 --> 00:12:54,670
THEN IT WAS SIMPLY A MATTER

238
00:12:54,704 --> 00:12:57,155
OF INFECTING ONE OF THE RAT'S DATA BITS

239
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,883
WITH A LINE OF CODE THAT, ONCE CONVERTED INTO MATTER,

240
00:13:00,918 --> 00:13:03,679
BECAME A HOMING BEACON...

241
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:06,440
WHICH LED ME RIGHT TO YOU...

242
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:09,927
AND THIS MOST AUSPICIOUS OCCASION.

243
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:23,457
OH.

244
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,744
YOU CRASHED THE WRONG WEDDING, KHAN!

245
00:13:57,871 --> 00:13:59,942
DONNIE, WE'LL HANDLE THE SHREDDER.

246
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:02,013
GET MASTER SPLINTER OUT OF HERE.

247
00:14:02,048 --> 00:14:05,016
YOU'LL HANDLE NOTHING.

248
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:11,989
YOUR ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY ME HAVE ONLY MADE ME FASTER...

249
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:14,508
STRONGER!

250
00:14:22,758 --> 00:14:25,865
AND IT WILL NOW COST YOU EVERYTHING.

251
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:29,661
IT IS TIME.

252
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:07,216
FAREWELL, WORMS.

253
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:21,851
OH, DEAR!

254
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:29,031
NO! NO!NO!NO!

255
00:15:36,004 --> 00:15:39,524
AND NOW IT IS YOUR TURN TO PERISH.

256
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:45,530
WAIT. LOOK!

257
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:47,808
SOMETHING'S STILL MOVING IN THERE.

258
00:15:47,843 --> 00:15:49,120
DONNIE, CHECK IT OUT.

259
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:51,329
MIKEY AND I WILL BACK UP RAPH.

260
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:58,164
YOUR BROTHER IS WISE TO RUN.

261
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:02,823
STILL, HE ONLY POSTPONES THE INEVITABLE.

262
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:05,654
I WILL DESTROY YOU ALL.

263
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:16,768
EVERYONE OUT! HURRY!

264
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:31,576
COME ON.

265
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:34,096
WE'VE GOT TO GET MASTER SPLINTER BACK TO THE HAULER.

266
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:36,754
IT'S SAFE, AND IT MIGHT JUST GIVE US OUR ONLY CHANCE

267
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,411
AT BEATING THE SHREDDER.

268
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,285
FINISH THEM.

269
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,530
THE SHREDDER SAID HE HAD A DIGITAL CORE.

270
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:57,361
IF WE CAN GET A SAMPLING OF THAT CORE'S CODING SIGNATURE,

271
00:16:57,395 --> 00:17:00,260
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE IT AGAINST HIM.

272
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:02,193
Serling: A DIGITAL CORE?

273
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:04,092
BUT I THOUGHT IN THIS WORLD,

274
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:06,404
THE SHREDDER WAS MADE ENTIRELY OF MATTER.

275
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:07,750
SO DID I.

276
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:10,270
BUT SINCE THIS SHREDDER WAS BORN OUT OF VIRAL'S BODY,

277
00:17:10,305 --> 00:17:13,342
HE MUST HAVE INHERITED SOME OF HER DIGITAL PROPERTIES.

278
00:17:13,377 --> 00:17:17,346
SO HOW DO WE GET THIS SAMPLING, MY SON?

279
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:21,212
WITH THIS!

280
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:23,490
THE SHREDDER INFECTED ONE OF YOUR DATA BITS

281
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:27,149
SO THAT, WHEN CONVERTED INTO MATTER, IT BECAME THIS BEACON.

282
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:30,152
IF WE COULD CONVERT IT BACK INTO CODE,

283
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:32,913
WE'LL HAVE OUR SAMPLE AND ALL THE DATA WE NEED

284
00:17:32,948 --> 00:17:36,089
TO DESTROY THE SHREDDER THE SAME WAY WE DESTROYED VIRAL...

285
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:38,471
WITH YOUR DECOMPILING BLAST.

286
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:46,065
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ODDS ARE

287
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,583
OF US GETTIN' THROUGH THIS?

288
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:51,518
STATISTICALLY SPEAKING...

289
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:54,452
BAD.

290
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:58,180
YEAH? WELL I'D SAY THEY JUST GOT A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

291
00:17:58,215 --> 00:17:59,354
LOOK!

292
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:06,878
IT'S THE JUSTICE FORCE.

293
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:08,535
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

294
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:17,026
OH, AND CONGRATULATIONS FROM ALL OF US.

295
00:18:39,946 --> 00:18:41,016
AAH!

296
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,776
THIS IS YOUR END.

297
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:44,951
Splinter: UNHAND MY SONS.

298
00:18:44,985 --> 00:18:46,849
WHAT?! HA!

299
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:49,231
WHAT COULD YOU POSSIBLY DO TO MAKE ME?

300
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:50,405
THIS!

301
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:01,278
PATHETIC.

302
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:04,212
YOU ARE POWERLESS TO DEFEAT ME.

303
00:19:04,246 --> 00:19:06,697
I CAN'T GET A SHOT THROUGH THAT SHIELD.

304
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:08,975
IT'S IMPERVIOUS TO THE DECOMPILER BEAM.

305
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:13,221
BUT PERHAPS IT IS NOT IMPERVIOUS TO FLESH AND BLOOD.

306
00:19:25,612 --> 00:19:28,063
GRRR!

307
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,552
I WILL NEVER FALL TO YOU, RAT.

308
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:38,832
IT WAS NOT MY AIM TO MAKE YOU FALL.

309
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:40,351
HUH?

310
00:19:42,526 --> 00:19:43,699
HUH?

311
00:19:45,736 --> 00:19:47,703
NO!

312
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:08,310
NICE SHOT! WAY TO GO, DONNIE!

313
00:20:11,762 --> 00:20:13,350
Casey: HEY, RAPH.

314
00:20:13,384 --> 00:20:14,765
I THINK I FINALLY FIGURED OUT

315
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,492
HOW TO TIE THIS THING.

316
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:20,288
CASEY!

317
00:20:20,322 --> 00:20:24,119
NOW, THEN, LET'S NOT LET A FEW BAD APPLES RUIN ALL THE FUN.

318
00:20:24,153 --> 00:20:26,432
I BELIEVE THERE'S A WEDDING TO BE HAD.

319
00:20:26,466 --> 00:20:27,433
YES.

320
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:30,263
BUT PERHAPS...OUTSIDE.

321
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:53,424
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I'VE BEEN TO THIS WEDDING,

322
00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:55,599
IT ALWAYS MAKES ME CRY.

323
00:20:55,633 --> 00:21:00,742
AND SO, BY THE POWERS VESTED IN ME BY PLANET D'HOONNIB,

324
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:05,333
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO PRONOUNCE YOU, CASEY JONES,

325
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:09,889
AND YOU, APRIL O'NEIL, MAN AND WIFE.

326
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:12,167
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.

327
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:23,627
YEAH! HA HA HA!
